I thought I'd write to you, then call you, then tell you to see. I know you do not deserve this, but in the end I'm not like you. I love everything that was between us and I am thankful in some places. You taught me to cherish a right man. You taught me to offer and know how to receive. You taught me to share worries and joys with dear man. It's just that you have not been right or dear to me. You simply were. You waited for the first step, then the second, then many more.Today I want you to know we gave up on both of us. What more ... I wondered a thousand times if I did the right thing and ten thousand times I said in my mind: YES!

How can I postpone what would have happened anyway? I cried a lot? I cried! And now the soul still suffers. Have I fought with the feelings I have left for you? I think I will fight with them for a while.

The fact is, I will not begging, I will not ask for love, I will not hope you will change again. Because this will never happen.

I gave up on the two of us and I gave a chance to myself and all the dreams that bound me to a man I swore to love a life. Now, after so long, I know this man has not come yet.In fact, I hope to meet him, I put an end to all that I would be in the way: a wrong past, a wrong man beside, a story that you could not call love only.

Today's a new beginning. Today is a new day. And it's snowing ...
